# Web-Scraping-Project-1-
NYC Data Academy Project 1

Day 1 - got datafiles
Day 1 - Datafiles were daily returns, combined the list into one DataFrame, filename = combined_csv.csv
Day 1 - started working on cleaning
Day 1 - End of day, I believe I am done with cleaning.  Just missing price_change_pct but deleted unnecessary rows and 0s and re-worked the format (str, int, float, date)

Day 2 - finished all but one of the cleaning, waiting on help for the last piece but outputed to start analysis
Day 2 - created new python file/code for the WSB Analysis, created 4 tables to focus on which stocks to choose from
